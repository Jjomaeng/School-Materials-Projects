#### 1. Introduction
- Based on the data analysis of subway users, it presents information for comfortable subway use.
  - A. For general users, the expected congestion level for each section is provided using subway
congestion statistics.
  - B. By investigating the boarding line, time zone, and seating of considerate seats from
pregnant women users, big data analysis for the expansion of considerate seats for
pregnant women promotes convenient use of the subway for pregnant women.
    - Since the current project is a simulation using only data on Line 2, only the number
of seats for considerate seats for each time period is shown on the UI.
  - C. It shows the lines and time zones with the highest utilization rate of considerate seats by
ranking.
    - Since the current project is a simulation using only data on Line 2, only the
utilization rate of considerate seats by time zone is shown on the UI.
